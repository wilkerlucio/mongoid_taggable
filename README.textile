h1. Mongoid Taggable

Mongoid Taggable provides some helpers to create taggable documents.

h2. Installation

You need simple install it as a Rails Plugin:

bc. script/plugin install git://github.com/wilkerlucio/mongoid_taggable.git

h2. Basic Usage

To make a document taggable you just need to include Mongoid::Taggable into your document:

bc.. class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Taggable
  
  field :title
  field :content
end

p. Them in your form:

bc.. <% form_for @post do |f| %>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :title %><br />
    <%= f.text_field :title %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :content %><br />
    <%= f.text_area :content %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :tags %><br />
    <%= f.text_field :tags %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
  </p>
<% end %>

p. In this case, the text fields for tags should receive the list of tags separated by colon (above in this document you will see how to change the separator)

p. Them your document will have the @tags@ and @tags_array@ getter and setter. The @tags@ you use as a plain string with tags separated by colon, the @tags_array@ is an array with tags, these two properties are automatic synchronized.

h2. Tags Indexing

This lib will automatic create for you and index of tags after save the document, this index is useful to get a list of all tags used in documents of this collection or to create a tag cloud. See the following example to understand how to use it:

bc.. Post.create!(:tags => "food,ant,bee")
Post.create!(:tags => "juice,food,bee,zip")
Post.create!(:tags => "honey,strip,food")

Post.tags # will retrieve ["ant", "bee", "food", "honey", "juice", "strip", "zip"]
Post.tags_with_weight # will retrieve:
# [
#   ['ant', 1],
#   ['bee', 2],
#   ['food', 3],
#   ['honey', 1],
#   ['juice', 1],
#   ['strip', 1],
#   ['zip', 1]
# ]

p. If you don't want to use this feature, its good to disable for improve performance:

bc.. class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Taggable
  
  disable_tags_index! # will disable index creation
  
  field :title
  field :content
end

h2. Changing default separator

To change default separator you just need to call @tags_separator@ method on class:

bc.. class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Taggable
  
  tags_separator ';' # will change tags separator to ;
  
  field :title
  field :content
end
