h1. Mongoid Taggable

Mongoid Taggable provides some helpers to create taggable documents.

h2. Installation

You can simple install from rubygems:

bc. gem install mongoid_taggable

or in Gemfile:

bc. gem 'mongoid_taggable'

or as a Rails Plugin:

bc. script/plugin install git://github.com/wilkerlucio/mongoid_taggable.git

h2. Basic Usage

To make a document taggable you need to include Mongoid::Taggable into your document and call the @taggable@ macro with optional arguments:

bc.. class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Taggable
  
  field :title
  field :content

  taggable
end

p. Them in your form:

bc.. <% form_for @post do |f| %>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :title %><br />
    <%= f.text_field :title %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :content %><br />
    <%= f.text_area :content %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :tags %><br />
    <%= f.text_field :tags %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
  </p>
<% end %>

p. In this case, the text fields for tags should receive the list of tags separated by comma (below in this document you will see how to change the separator).

p. Then your document will have the @tags@ and @tags_array@ getter and setter. The @tags@ you use as a plain string with tags separated by comma, and the @tags_array@ is an array with tags. These two properties are automatically synchronized.

h2. Tags Indexing

This lib will automatically create an index of tags and their counts for you after saving the document, useful for getting a list of all tags used in documents of this collection or to create a tag cloud. See the following example to understand how to use it:

bc.. Post.create!(:tags => "food,ant,bee")
Post.create!(:tags => "juice,food,bee,zip")
Post.create!(:tags => "honey,strip,food")

Post.tags # will retrieve ["ant", "bee", "food", "honey", "juice", "strip", "zip"]
Post.tags_with_weight # will retrieve:
# [
#   ['ant', 1],
#   ['bee', 2],
#   ['food', 3],
#   ['honey', 1],
#   ['juice', 1],
#   ['strip', 1],
#   ['zip', 1]
# ]

p. If you don't want to use this feature, it is good to disable it to improve performance:

bc.. class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Taggable

  field :title
  field :content

  taggable :index_weights => false
end

h2. Changing default separator

To change the default separator you may pass a @separator@ argument to the macro:

bc.. class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Taggable

  field :title
  field :content

  taggable :separator => ' '    # tags will be delineated by spaces
end
